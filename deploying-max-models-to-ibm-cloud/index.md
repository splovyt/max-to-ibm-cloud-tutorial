Looking to deploy a MAX model to IBM Cloud? Smart!

Fortunately, it's not only easy, but also free.Â 

## Learning objective

In this tutorial, we will use the Kubernetes system to deploy a cloud instance for your MAX model of choice. The Kubernetes service allows us to easily scale the containerized model from supporting a low rate of queries to production-level queries. The free IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is limited to 1 worker, but this will do fine for this application. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

If you are not familiar with the Model Asset Exchange, this [introductory article](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/introduction-to-the-model-asset-exchange-on-ibm-developer/) provides a good overview.

## Estimated time

It should take you approximately 45 minutes to complete this tutorial.

## Steps

This tutorial consists of the following steps:

* [Creating an IBM Cloud account](#creating-an-ibm-cloud-account)
* [Setting up a Kubernetes cluster](#setting-up-a-kubernetes-cluster)
* [Deploying the MAX model](#deploying-the-max-model)

### Creating an IBM Cloud account

### Setting up a Kubernetes cluster

### Deploying the MAX model

## Summary



* [Setup](#tutorial-setup)
* [Import the Model Asset Exchange nodes](#import-the-model-asset-exchange-nodes)
* [Explore the image caption generator node](#explore-the-image-caption-generator-node)
* [Generate an image caption](#generate-an-image-caption)

### Tutorial setup

1. Open a terminal window, start Node-RED `node-red`, and open the Node-RED editor by pointing your browser to the displayed URL, such as `http://127.0.0.1:1880`.

1. From the **&#9776;** menu, select **Manage palette**.

   ![Access the palette](images/hamburger_menu.png)

1. In the _Palette_ tab of the _User Settings_, select **Install**.
1. Search for the `node-red-contrib-browser-utils` module and install it if you don't already have it installed.
1. Close the settings window.

   ![Import prerequisite modules](images/install_prerequisite_modules.png)

1. Verify that the _camera_ and _file inject_ nodes are listed in the _input_ category. You'll use these nodes later in this tutorial.

   ![Lights - camera - action](images/palette_with_browser_utils_nodes.png)

### Import the Model Asset Exchange nodes

The Model Asset Exchange nodes are published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-model-asset-exchange).

1. From the **&#9776;** menu, select **Manage palette**.
1. In the _Palette_ tab of the _User Settings_, select **Install**.
1. Search for the `node-red-contrib-model-asset-exchange` module and install it.
1. Close the settings window.

  Several nodes should be displayed in the _Model Asset eXchange_ category.

   ![Palette with MAX nodes](images/palette_with_max_nodes.png)

   Each Model Asset Exchange node uses the endpoints of a deep learning microservice that you can run in a local environment or in the cloud.

   ![A node exposes the functions of a deep learning microservice](images/node_microservice_association.png)

To keep this tutorial simple, you'll associate your nodes with hosted demo microservice instances. To learn how to run your own microservice instance in a local environment, refer to [this tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-the-ibm-code-model-asset-exchange/).

### Explore the image caption generator node

For illustrative purposes, you'll be using the image caption generator node, which analyzes an image and generates a caption. If you prefer, you can follow along using a different node. The steps and concepts covered in this tutorial apply to all nodes.

1. Drag the **image caption generator** node onto the workspace and review the displayed information. The node has one input and one output (the microservice response).

1. Double-click the node to edit it. Two node properties are listed: _service_ and _method_.

   ![Image caption generator node default configuration](images/image_caption_node_default_config.png)

1. Edit the _service_ node property to associate the node with an instance of the image caption generator microservice.

1. By default, _host_ is pre-populated with the URL of a hosted demo instance of this microservice, which you can use to explore its capabilities. Click **Add** to associate this demo instance with your node.

   ![Image caption generator node service configuration](images/image_caption_node_service_config.png)

    > Never use hosted demo microservice instances for production workloads. To use your own (local or cloud) microservice instance, enter its URL (for example, `http://127.0.0.1:5000` if you are running the service on your local machine using the pre-built Docker container from Docker Hub).

1. The Model Asset Exchange microservices expose multiple endpoints, which are listed under the _method_ property. By default, the _predict_ method is selected, which analyzes the node's input. From the drop-down list, select **metadata** to retrieve information about the microservice.

   ![Image caption generator node configuration](images/image_caption_node_config.png)

   > Some methods accept optional parameters, such as a threshold value. (There are none for the image caption generator.)

1. Close the node's properties window.

1. Drag an **inject** _input_ node onto the workspace and connect its output to the input of the image _caption generator_ node.

   > The node name automatically changes to _timestamp_. (We are only using this node to run the flow. The _metadata_ method of the microservices does not require any input.)

1. Drag a **debug** output node onto the workspace and connect its input to the output of the _image caption generator_ node.

   Your completed flow should look like the following image.

   ![This flow retrieves microservice metadata](images/image_caption_metadata_flow.png)

1. Deploy the flow.

1. From the **&#9776;** menu, select **View** > **Debug messages** to open the debug output view.

1. Click the _inject_ node's button to inject a message into the flow and inspect the debug output. If your setup is correct, the output should look like:

   ```
    {
     "id":"im2txt-tensorflow",
     "name":"im2txt TensorFlow Model",
     "description":"im2txt TensorFlow model trained on MSCOCO",
     "license":"APACHE V2"
    }
   ```

You've just confirmed that the node can connect to the specified service. Next, you'll modify the flow to generate an image caption.

### Generate an image caption

The image caption generator's `predict` method analyzes the provided input image and generates a brief description of the image's content.

1. Double-click the _image caption generator_ node to edit its properties.
1. Change the selected _method_ from _metadata_ to **predict**.
1. Replace the _inject_ node with the **file inject** node (or the **camera** node - only supported in Chrome or Firefox) and connect its output to the _image caption generator_ node.

    ![Configure file node](images/image_caption_prediction_flow.png)

1. Deploy the flow.
1. Click the **file inject** (or **camera**) node's button to select an image (or take a picture) and inspect the debug output, which should contain a caption describing the image.

    ```
    a man sitting on a bench with a dog .
    ```

   You can access the entire microservice JSON response through the message object.

1. Open the _debug_ node's properties and change the output to **complete msg object**.
1. Redeploy the flow and rerun it.
1. Inspect the output. The message `details` contain a `predictions` array that contains generated captions.

    ```
    {
     "payload": "a man sitting on a bench with a dog .",
     "_msgid": "e8f93edc.7eddd",
     "statusCode": 200,
     ...
     "details": {
        "status": "ok",
        "predictions": [
            {
                "index": "0",
                "caption": "a man sitting on a bench with a dog .",
                "probability": 0.00033009440665662435
            },
            {
                "index": "1",
                "caption": "a teddy bear sitting on a bench in a park",
                "probability": 0.00009953154282018676
            }
        ]
     }
    }
    ```

### Explore other model nodes

The `node-red-contrib-model-asset-exchange` module includes a couple getting started flows that you can import into your workspace.

1. From the **&#9776;** menu, select **Import** > **Examples** > **model asset-exchange** > **getting started**.

    ![Import Model Asset Exchange example flows](images/import_sample_flows.png)

1. Select one of the flows to import it into your workspace.
1. Review the pre-configured flow, deploy, and run it.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to use the Model Asset Exchange nodes, feel free to try out some of the more complex Raspberry Pi flows that we've published in the [Node-RED library](https://flows.nodered.org/?term=max&type=flow).
